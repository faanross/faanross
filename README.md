## hi.

I'm a security researcher at [Active Countermeasures](https://www.activecountermeasures.com) specializing in post-exploitation malware development and network-centric threat hunting. While these disciplines may appear divergent, I see them as two sides of the same coin - cultivating competence in one deepens insight into the other.

I also teach a number of workshops and courses about **C2 development in Golang with AntiSyphon**, you can find info on these [here](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/instructor/faan-ross/).

You can find more of my work - articles, guide, courses etc - [here](https://faanross.com) . 

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to connect - **moi@faanross.com**. 

Live long and prosper.

Faan
