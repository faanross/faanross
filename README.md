## hi.

I'm a security researcher at [Active Countermeasures](https://www.activecountermeasures.com) that ponders one specific question: **how to detect C2 frameworks && malware network communication more broadly.**

In the quest to become hopefully somewhat competent at this I like approaching the challenge from both sides.

Donning my defensive hat I think about ways to tease out C2 communication by taking a **statistical + fingerprinting approach**. 

And to better understand exactly **how C2 communicates**, or even better, how it **_could_ still potentially communicate**, 
I love developing C2 emulation tools, almost exclusively in **Go**.

You can find more of my work - articles, guide, courses etc - [here](https://faanross.com) . 

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to connect with me - **moi@faanross.com**. 

Live long and prosper.

Faan
