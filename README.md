## hi.

I'm a security researcher at [Active Countermeasures](https://www.activecountermeasures.com) interested in post-exploitation malware development, covert channels, offensive sec tooling, network-centric threat hunting etc.

I teach a number of workshops and courses about **C2 development in Golang with AntiSyphon**, you can find info on these [here](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/instructor/faan-ross/).

You can find more of my work - articles, guide, courses etc - [here](https://faanross.com) . 

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to connect - **moi@faanross.com**. 

Live long and prosper.

Faan
